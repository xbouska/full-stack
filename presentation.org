** TODO How complete it is [0%]
- [ ] Not much
  - [ ] a skeleton (the first level is +/- defined)
  - [ ] there is not a single point that I consider 100% complete
  - [ ] it is living document
  - [ ] it will be never completed as new things are coming and old are getting obsolete
** TODO What is it good for (me personally)
- [ ] I listen, watch and read a lot (particularly IT topics)
  - [ ] I keep track on topics that I consider useful
  - [ ] I share a lot of what I have read found recently with my colleagues by #SLACK ...
** TODO What is it good for in EDH
- [ ] initially ... set of remarks used during potential new team member candidate
- [ ] now chapter leaders are also using this for finding chapter subjects
- [ ] team members to find new area of interrest
** TODO How can It be useful for me?
*** You can see what EDH is using [0%]
- [ ] Well not 100%
  - Main Frame is not there (COBOL, CICS, IMS, JCL,PL/1, )
  - AS/400 is not there (RPG SYNON DB2)
- [ ] There are technologies that are not in our stack actively
  - Haskell, Scala
  - I just consider them useful
** TODO How to use it
- [ ] Just browse the HTML version and be inspired
- [ ] it is available on the gitlabee even for modification
- [ ] maybe ... to migrate to github in order to keep it opened 
  - [ ] no secrets there  ... nothing any outsider can misuse against Renault
** TODO Original work
- [ ] not at all :-( - I copy paste from official documentation, blogs, wikipedia
  - [ ] there is *always* link to original source - my aim is not to steal someone else work
  - [ ] credit is kept ... (need to be sure)

** TODO Can I Help
*** I don`t know ...
- [ ] It is in org-mode (a variant of MD format)
*** So what? MD and org-mode are almost identical
- [ ] OK ping me then ...
  - [ ] I can open the repository for writing
  - [ ] or we can agree on pull requests
** TODO How is it organized
- [ ] tree like structure
- [ ] TAGS
- [ ] properties
- [ ] small elisp scripts for "re-collection and building links"

** TODO Emacs? WTF we are not in 1976?
- [ ] single self contained document - no need a server
- [ ] well it is just a text file
  - [ ] use IDEA, Sublime, VS Code, Notepad++
- [ ] if you want to consume you can use browser
